### during the course ...
- implemented nn with pure numpy ✅
- tuned nn to perform with error rate less than 1% on MNIST ✅
- implemented extreme learning machine ✅
- got familiar with optuna hyperparameter tuner ✅
- implemented multiple performance-improving tricks: dropout, polyak averaging, momentum, pruning, batch norm, data augmentation, norm constraint ✅
- got familiar with SHAP/LIME automated model explainers ✅
- implemented integrated gradients features importances meausiring ✅
